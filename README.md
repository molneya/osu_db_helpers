# osu! db helpers

Useful functions to manage your osu!.db.

## Usage

You can download the executable from the [releases](https://github.com/molneya/osu_db_helpers/releases) page.

Run it from the command line with your osu! folder as an argument, or drag your osu! folder on top of the executable.

## Warning

Make sure you close osu! before running any commands or else osu! will overwrite it.
I would also recommend backing up your `osu!.db` before doing this. I am not responsible for any database corruption or data loss you may experience.

## Data

Rankeed data is up to date as of 2025-05-06.

If you require more recent data, create your own `ranked_data.csv` in the format `beatmapset_id,timestamp`. The program will read it automatically.
